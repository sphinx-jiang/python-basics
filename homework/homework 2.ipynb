    "#### design and implement the following classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this homework is to let you be familiar with writing classes in Python. You are encouraged to be creative when working on this assignment. There is no \"best solution\" to the design of your classes. \n",

    "- A class **Bank**, including bank name, bank balance, bank ID, accounts, employees. The bank class should have the following functions: adding an account to the bank, remove an account from the bank, and the balance shall be updated accordingly, etc. \n",

    "- The aforementioned facts are the aspects that must be implemented, you are encouraged to be creative. Add whatever features(classes, fields, methods, super class) you think are useful to your code. \n",
    "- organize your class prototypes and your script of code in different files and import them properly. "
